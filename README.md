# 💡 Day 1: Python Name Generator

Welcome to Day 1 of my 100 Days of Python learning journey!  
This is a simple **Name Generator** project built using basic Python concepts like strings, variables, and user input.

---

## 📌 What I Learned
- Variables in Python
- String manipulation
- User input using `input()`
- Basic print statements
- F-strings and concatenation

## 🛠️ How It Works

The program asks for:
1. Your city name
2. Your pet’s name

Then combines them to generate a fun band name! 🎸

Example:


Welcome to the Band Name Generator!
What's the name of the city you grew up in? Delhi
What's your pet’s name? Simba
Your band name could be: Delhi Simba
